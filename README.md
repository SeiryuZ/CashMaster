# Cash Master

This is the readme file for the final of the Wireless Mobile Software Engineering course. Our goal with this project is to create a useful application for people's lives in Jakarta and around the world. Also, to create an app that is worth a high score for our current semester.

### Developers:

## Problem

Financial management is a necessity for a bright and stable future. From finding the correct living situation, saving for retirement, or spending money on the department store, money is a huge part of our lives, and keeping up to date with your budget might be hard for many people. Financial management should be practiced from a young age to ensure a good future for our country, which, from our point of view, are not being thought that well.

Schools taught us how to do calculus, to speak french, and about ancient rocks in borneo, but rarely do they taught us about taxes, or investing, or budgeting, and while taxes and investments can be taught later in life, managing your spending needs to be taught as early as possible.

## Proposed Solution

With the Cash Master, you could insert your spendings and income into your app, put them in categories, and Cash Master will inform you of your financial status within microseconds. With intuitive design, using the app will be relaxing while also helpful, and will enforce a good habit of managing your budget.

### Core Features

* Tracks user's income & spending
* Reminding user of overspending
* Helps user create a spending plan
* Divides income into seperate "Jars": 50% for monthly bills, 20% for savings, and 30% for entertainment

### Related work

According to our opinion and standards, there are no financial manager app that is easy to use nor with the functionalities that we would have wanted in the market right now. That is part of why the idea to make this app appeared.
